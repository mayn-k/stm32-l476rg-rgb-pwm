# stm32-l476rg-rgb-pwm
This project interfaces an RGB LED module with a GPIO Pin on an STM32 Nucleo Board. The RGB LED module consists of individual LEDs for red, green, and blue, each controlled independently. PWM signals with varying duty cycles are generated using STM32's Timer peripherals to control the brightness of each LED.
